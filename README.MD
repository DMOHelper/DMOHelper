## ![Icon](https://github.com/DMOHelper/DMOHelper/blob/master/DMOManager/Images/Icon48.png?raw=true) DMOHelper

A small helper tool for Digimon Masters Online.

### Note

This application uses [Syncfusion](http://syncfusion.com)'s UI Elements.

If you clone my code and want to use the WPF-Application, you have to get your own Syncfusion license and register it at [App.xaml.cs](DMOManager/App.xaml.cs). There is a free community version available, which you can use if you meet the requirements. If you use the compiled **release** versions, an own Syncfusion License is **not required**.

### Download links
You can get your latest version from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DMOHelper/DMOHelper/master/Installer/setup.exe) via ClickOnce Distribution and Updates.

### Disclaimer and License
Please refer to the [License](LICENSE.txt).

This App is freeware and has no commercial use. However, you can support me during my college by donating to my Ethereum Wallet: 0xFf159b4E3e4a117A453e36Dc17e74978BFCDE4b7
