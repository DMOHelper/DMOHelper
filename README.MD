## ![Icon](https://github.com/DMOHelper/DMOHelper/blob/master/DMOManager/Images/Icon48.png?raw=true) DMOHelper

A small helper tool for Digimon Masters Online.

### Note

This application uses
- [Syncfusion](http://syncfusion.com)'s UI Elements
- [Josh Close](https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/)'s CSV Helper
- [MahApps](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro.IconPacks)'s IconPacks

If you clone my code and change it, you have to get your own Syncfusion license and register it at [App.xaml.cs](DMOManager/App.xaml.cs). There is a free community version available, which you can use if you meet the requirements. If you use the compiled **release** versions, an own Syncfusion License is **not required**.

### Download links
You can get your latest version from [here](https://github.com/DMOHelper/DMOHelper/raw/master/Installer/setup.exe) via ClickOnce Distribution and Updates.

### License
Please refer to the [License](LICENSE.txt).

### Disclaimer
Please note, that, since GameKing doesn't give out informations on how the game works, informations in the StatCalculator function are mostly gathered via Trial-and-Error, so no guarantee on the informations like Damage Calculation being correct.
